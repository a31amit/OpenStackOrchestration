This repo is a collection for Ansible playbooks that were created to set up
an OpenStack environment. The playbook was designed for Octa which is no longer
in use. This repo will be updated to the latest OpenStack versions as time goes on.

The target distro is CentOS 7.4 with a minimal installation. This playbook is just
for testing out OpenStack and not intended for production environments.
